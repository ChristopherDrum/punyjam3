## Jam Theme
`The game must start in or at an airlock.`

## Approach
~This game heavily cribs from 80's cartoons, most especially from G.I. Joe. The game follows "Strike Force" operatives as they infiltrate a secret underwater research facility run by VENOM. Raven, Freedive and Snowblind start at the airlock of the facility and must covertly secure information that will allow Strike Force to learn more about VENOM's plans.~
The original approach was severely altered due to time constraints for the contest.

The new approach is that Raven and Snowdrift (new name) are infiltrating an arctic research lab run by HAVOC (wanted a non-snake, non-M.A.S.K villianous organization, which might change again).
